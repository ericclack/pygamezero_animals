Welcome to Animal Simulation Tutorial for Pygame Zero!
======================================================

In this tutorial we'll make a simulation of animals with a flock and a
preditor. You'll learn about object orientation, classes and forces of
attraction, including some geometry maths.

If you've not yet set up Pygame Zero and the editor Mu, head over to
our `Flappy Bird Tutorial`_ and follow the instructions there.

If you're new to Python programming then that Flappy Bird tutorial is
probably better place to start -- this tutorial is significantly
harder.
